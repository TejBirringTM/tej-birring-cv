Responsible for the software implementation of the 5G software-defined radio (SDR) testbed at the University of Kent.

* Analysed and modified large-scale open source codebases for 4G LTE emulation (OpenAirInterface, srsLTE/srsENB)

  * Implemented MAC-PHY functional split of LTE protocol stack

* Developed software tools for collecting, processing, and visualising network performance statistics in realtime

  * Quantitatively evaluated Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures against traditional Distributed-Radio Access Network (D-RAN) systems

* Designed and implemented LTE MAC/PHY Radio-over-Ethernet (RoE) packet processing for Baseband Unit (BBU) and Remote Radio Unit (RRU)  

* Optimised software for realtime processing on Linux systems, considering interprocess communication, thread scheduling, CPU core allocation, and more

* Collaborated on hardware-software architecture for offloading packet processing to FPGA-based embedded platform

* Conducted experiments with research partners and supervised MEng students
