* Implemented MAC-PHY functional split of LTE protocol stack using open source software-defined radio (SDR) platforms (OpenAirInterface, srsLTE/srsENB)

* Analysed and modified large-scale open source codebases for 4G LTE emulation

* Developed real-time software tools for collecting, processing, and visualising time-sensitive data

* Designed and implemented LTE MAC/PHY Radio-over-Ethernet (RoE) packet processing for Baseband Unit (BBU) and Remote Radio Unit (RRU)

* Optimised software for real-time processing on Linux systems, considering thread scheduling and CPU core allocation

* Collaborated on hardware-software architecture for FPGA-based packet processing offloading

* Conducted experiments with research partners and supervised MEng students

* Quantitatively evaluated Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures against traditional Distributed-Radio Access Network (D-RAN) systems
